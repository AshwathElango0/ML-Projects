# Project Details

The file 'main_code.py' uses a fine-tuned DONUT model to extract key information from a dataset of invoices, and performs post-processing on them.
It writes the predictions onto a .csv file.

The file 'image_info_extractor.py' contains code for a Streamlit app, which allows the user to select an image from the dataset of bills using a slider.
When they select an image, its information is extracted and shown below.
